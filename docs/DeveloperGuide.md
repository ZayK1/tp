## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

#### ResultDisplay HTML Rendering

The `ResultDisplay` component uses JavaFX `WebView` to render command feedback with rich HTML/CSS formatting:

* **Theme Support**: Automatically switches between dark and light themes via `setTheme(boolean)` method, called by `MainWindow` during theme toggle.
* **Message Formatting**: Converts plain text messages to styled HTML with syntax highlighting for student IDs, module codes, numbers, and tags.
* **Visual Design**: Uses iOS-inspired color scheme with gradient headers, rounded borders, and monospace fonts for code elements.
* **Compliance**: Maintains CLI-first approach - WebView is output-only with context menu disabled. All user input remains keyboard-driven through `CommandBox`.

**Note**: The HTML/CSS generation methods in `ResultDisplay` have lower test coverage as they contain presentation logic that is better validated through manual UI testing.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### View Student Feature

#### Implementation

The view student feature allows teaching assistants to view detailed information about a specific student, including their personal details and complete attendance record. It is implemented through the `ViewCommand` command class and `ViewCommandParser` parser class.

**Key Components:**

The `ViewCommand` class:
- Supports two methods of identifying students: by index in the displayed list or by student ID
- Filters the displayed list to show only the selected student
- Generates a comprehensive detailed view message containing student information and attendance records
- Displays attendance week-by-week in the result display with text symbols (âœ“ for present, âœ— for absent) and status text

The `ViewCommandParser`:
- Parses user input to determine whether the user is searching by index or student ID
- Uses the presence of `s/` prefix to differentiate between index-based and ID-based lookup
- Creates appropriate `ViewCommand` objects with either an `Index` or `StudentId` parameter

**Execution Flow:**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view mechanism behaves.

**Step 1.** The user executes `view 1` or `view s/A0123456X` to view a student's details.

**Step 2.** The command is parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which identifies it as a view command and creates a `ViewCommandParser`.

**Step 3.** `ViewCommandParser` parses the arguments:
- If `s/` prefix is present: Extracts and validates the student ID, creates a `ViewCommand(StudentId)`
- If no prefix: Parses the argument as an index, creates a `ViewCommand(Index)`

**Step 4.** When `ViewCommand#execute()` is called:
- If using index: Gets the person at the specified index from the filtered person list
- If using student ID: Calls `Model#findPersonByStudentId()` to locate the student
- Throws `CommandException` if student not found or index is invalid
- Calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to filter and show only the selected student
- Generates detailed view message via `createDetailedViewMessage(Person)`
- Returns a `CommandResult` with the formatted message

**Step 5.** The `createDetailedViewMessage()` method:
- Formats basic student information (name, student ID, email)
- Lists all enrolled module codes
- Lists all tags if present
- Displays attendance record sorted by week number
- Shows each week's status with symbols (âœ“/âœ—) and text (Present/Absent) in the result display

The following sequence diagram shows how a view operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/ViewSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `view 1` Command" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Dual lookup methods (index vs student ID)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Support both index and student ID lookup
  * Pros: Flexible for different use cases. Index is quick for visible students; student ID works regardless of filter state. Accommodates different user workflows.
  * Cons: More complex parsing logic. Need to handle two different code paths in execution.

* **Alternative 2:** Support only index-based lookup
  * Pros: Simpler implementation. Consistent with other commands like delete, edit.
  * Cons: Less convenient when user knows student ID but student is not visible in current list. Requires additional find/list commands first.

**Aspect: Display format for attendance**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Two different display formats optimized for their context
  * ResultDisplay (from `view` command): Each week displayed individually with symbols (âœ“/âœ—) and text (Present/Absent) for detailed review
  * PersonCard (UI list): Visual grid of 13 colored rectangles with rounded edges - grey for no record, green (#4CAF50) for present, red (#F44336) for absent
  * Pros: ResultDisplay format is clear for detailed inspection during `view` command. PersonCard grid provides instant visual pattern recognition across entire semester at a glance. Optimized for different use cases - detailed examination vs quick scanning.
  * Cons: Two different display implementations to maintain. Users need to understand both representations. More complex UI code for PersonCard grid.

* **Alternative 2:** Single consistent text-based format in both displays
  * Pros: Consistent user experience across all views. Simpler implementation with single formatting method. Easier to maintain.
  * Cons: Text format in PersonCard takes more horizontal space. Harder to see attendance patterns quickly. Less intuitive for visual scanning across multiple students in the list.

**Aspect: List filtering after view**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filter list to show only viewed student
  * Pros: Focuses user attention on the selected student. Reduces visual clutter. Clear indication of which student is being viewed.
  * Cons: Requires user to run `list` command to see all students again. Changes the displayed list state.

* **Alternative 2:** Keep list unchanged, show details in popup or side panel
  * Pros: Preserves list context. User can view multiple students without losing their place.
  * Cons: Requires more complex UI components. Less suitable for CLI-focused application.

### Attendance Tracking Feature

#### Implementation

The attendance tracking feature allows teaching assistants to mark and track student attendance for weekly tutorial sessions. It is implemented through the `AttendanceRecord` model class, `AttendanceCommand` command class, and supporting classes `Week`, `AttendanceStatus`.

**Key Components:**

The `AttendanceRecord` class:
- Immutable data structure storing week-to-status mappings
- Uses `Map<Week, AttendanceStatus>` internally for efficient lookup
- Supports marking, querying, and retrieving all attendance records
- Returns new `AttendanceRecord` instances when marking attendance (defensive copying)

The `Week` class:
- Represents tutorial week numbers (1-13, corresponding to a typical semester)
- Validates week numbers are within valid range
- Implements proper equality for use as map keys

The `AttendanceStatus` enum:
- Two states: `PRESENT` and `ABSENT`
- Case-insensitive parsing from user input

The `AttendanceCommand`:
- Supports marking attendance for individual students by student ID
- Supports bulk marking attendance for all students using `s/all`
- Takes week number and attendance status as parameters
- Creates updated `Person` objects with new attendance records

The `PersonCard` UI component:
- Displays attendance visually in the student list using a grid of 13 rectangles (16x16 pixels each with rounded edges)
- Each rectangle represents one week (1-13) of the semester
- Color coding: Grey (#CCCCCC) for no record, Green (#4CAF50) for present, Red (#F44336) for absent
- Week numbers displayed above rectangles for easy reference
- Provides instant visual pattern recognition of attendance across the entire semester

**Execution Flow:**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the attendance marking mechanism behaves.

**Step 1.** The user executes `attendance s/A0123456X w/1 present` to mark a student present for week 1.

**Step 2.** The command is parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which identifies it as an attendance command and creates an `AttendanceCommandParser`.

**Step 3.** `AttendanceCommandParser` parses the arguments:
- Extracts student ID (`A0123456X`) or detects `all` keyword
- Extracts week number (`1`) and validates it's between 1-13
- Parses attendance status (`present`) into `AttendanceStatus.PRESENT`
- Creates an `AttendanceCommand` with these parameters

**Step 4.** When `AttendanceCommand#execute()` is called:
- Determines if single student or all students should be marked
- For single student:
  - Calls `Model#findPersonByStudentId()` to locate the student
  - Throws `CommandException` if student not found
  - Gets current `AttendanceRecord` from the student
  - Calls `AttendanceRecord#markAttendance(week, status)` to get updated record
  - Creates new `Person` object with updated attendance record
  - Calls `Model#setPerson()` to replace old person with updated person
- For all students:
  - Iterates through all students in address book
  - Updates each student's attendance record similarly
  - Counts number of students updated
- Returns `CommandResult` with success message

**Step 5.** The model persists the changes:
- Updated person list triggers storage save
- Attendance data is serialized to JSON format
- Data is written to disk automatically

The following sequence diagram shows how an attendance marking operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/AttendanceSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `attendance s/A0123456X w/1 present` Command" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Attendance record storage**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store attendance as part of `Person` object
  * Pros: Direct association between person and their attendance. Easy to access when viewing student details. Follows object-oriented principles. Simplifies serialization and storage.
  * Cons: Attendance data is duplicated if needed elsewhere. Cannot easily query attendance independently.

* **Alternative 2:** Store attendance in separate `AttendanceBook` class
  * Pros: Separation of concerns. Can query attendance data independently. Supports attendance-focused operations (e.g., "show all students absent in week 3").
  * Cons: More complex architecture. Requires maintaining relationships between Person and AttendanceRecord. More complex serialization logic.

**Aspect: Immutability of AttendanceRecord**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Immutable AttendanceRecord
  * Pros: Thread-safe. Prevents accidental modifications. Fits functional programming paradigm. Easier to reason about state changes. Consistent with other model classes.
  * Cons: Creates new objects on every update. Slightly higher memory usage. Requires creating new Person object for each attendance change.

* **Alternative 2:** Mutable AttendanceRecord
  * Pros: More efficient for frequent updates. No need to recreate objects. Direct modification of state.
  * Cons: Risk of unintended side effects. Thread safety concerns. Harder to track state changes. Inconsistent with existing codebase patterns.

**Aspect: Bulk attendance marking**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Support `s/all` to mark all students
  * Pros: Very convenient for TAs marking full-class attendance. Saves time when all students share same status. Single command instead of N commands.
  * Cons: Requires special parsing logic for "all" keyword. All-or-nothing operation (cannot mark most students one way, exceptions another way). Risk of accidental bulk operations.

* **Alternative 2:** Require individual marking for each student
  * Pros: More explicit, less risk of mistakes. Simpler parsing logic. Forces TAs to verify each student.
  * Cons: Tedious for large classes. Time-consuming when most students have same status. Many repetitive commands.

**Aspect: Week number validation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Validate weeks are between 1-13
  * Pros: Matches typical NUS semester structure. Prevents obviously invalid data. Provides clear error messages to users.
  * Cons: Not flexible for special terms or non-standard schedules. Hard-coded constraint.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow any positive week number
  * Pros: Flexible for different semester structures. Works for special terms, summer sessions, etc.
  * Cons: Allows potentially meaningless data (e.g., week 100). No validation against errors. Harder to generate meaningful reports.

### Grade Feature

#### Implementation

The grade feature allows teaching assistants to add, view, and manage grades for students' assignments. It is implemented through the `Grade` model class and the `GradeCommand` command class.

**Key Components:**

The `Grade` class:
- Stores an assignment name and a score (0-100)
- Is immutable to prevent unintended modifications
- Validates that scores are numeric and within valid range using regex pattern `^(100|[0-9]{1,2})$`
- Implements proper `equals()` and `hashCode()` for use in collections

The `GradeCommand`:
- Takes an index and one or more grade entries in the format `g/ASSIGNMENT_NAME:SCORE`
- Finds the person at the specified index in the filtered person list
- Creates a new `Person` object with the updated grades (defensive copying)
- Checks for duplicate grades (same assignment name) and prevents them
- Only allows adding grades to students (persons with StudentId)

**Execution Flow:**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the grade mechanism behaves.

**Step 1.** The user executes `grade 1 g/Midterm:85` to add a grade for the 1st student.

**Step 2.** The command is parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which identifies it as a grade command and creates a `GradeCommandParser`.

**Step 3.** `GradeCommandParser` parses the arguments:
- Extracts the index (1)
- Extracts the grade string ("Midterm:85")
- Splits on the colon to get assignment name "Midterm" and score "85"
- Creates a `Grade` object after validation
- Creates a `GradeCommand` with the index and set of grades

**Step 4.** When `GradeCommand#execute()` is called:
- Gets the person at index 1 from the filtered person list using `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`
- Validates the person has a StudentId (only students can have grades)
- Checks for duplicate grades by comparing assignment names
- Creates a new `Person` with the existing grades plus the new grade
- Updates the model with `Model#setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson)`
- Returns a `CommandResult` with success message

The following sequence diagram shows how the grade operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/GradeSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="GradeSequenceDiagram" />

**Note:** The lifeline for `GradeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How grades are stored**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store grades as a `Set<Grade>` in the `Person` class
  * Pros: Simple, direct association between Person and Grade. Using a Set prevents duplicate grades automatically. Easy to retrieve all grades for a person.
  * Cons: Grades cannot be accessed independently of persons. Cannot easily query all grades across all students.

* **Alternative 2:** Store grades in a separate `GradeBook` class
  * Pros: Better separation of concerns, allows grade-specific operations like calculating class average. Can query grades independently.
  * Cons: More complex architecture, requires maintaining bidirectional references between Person and Grade. Higher coupling between components.

**Aspect: Duplicate grade handling**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Prevent duplicates by checking assignment names
  * Pros: Ensures data consistency, prevents accidental overwrites. Clear error message to user.
  * Cons: Cannot easily update an existing grade - must delete first then add. More validation logic needed.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow duplicates and keep all versions
  * Pros: Maintains history of grade changes. Simpler implementation.
  * Cons: Confusing for users which grade is "current". Takes more storage space. Need additional logic to determine which grade to display.

**Aspect: Grade validation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Validate in `Grade` constructor
  * Pros: Ensures all Grade objects are valid (fail-fast). Defensive programming - impossible to create invalid grade. Validation logic centralized in one place.
  * Cons: Cannot create Grade object with invalid data even for testing purposes.

* **Alternative 2:** Validate only when parsing user input
  * Pros: More flexible for internal use and testing. Can create temporary Grade objects during processing.
  * Cons: Risk of invalid grades propagating through the system. Validation logic scattered across multiple parsers.

### Consultation Feature

#### Implementation

The consultation feature allows teaching assistants to record and view student consultation sessions as part of each studentâ€™s profile. Unlike other standalone commands, consultations are implemented as an **attribute of each student**, and can be added or modified **only through the `add` or `edit` commands**.

Consultations are stored within each `Person` object as a list of `Consultation` instances, each representing a single consultation date and time.

**Key Components:**

The `Consultation` class:
- Represents an individual consultation with a `LocalDateTime` attribute
- Provides accessor and formatting methods to return a readable date/time string
- Supports multiple date/time input formats for user convenience

The `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` classes:
- Allow consultations to be provided as part of the `c/` prefix when adding or editing a student
- Construct or update a `Person` object that includes the parsed consultations
- Ensure that consultation data is properly stored, persisted, and displayed

The `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser` classes:
- Extract and validate all consultation values provided using the `c/` prefix
- Support multiple datetime input formats (e.g., `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`, `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`, etc.)
- Create corresponding `Consultation` objects and include them when constructing the `Person` to be added or edited

#### Execution Flow

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the consultation mechanism behaves during both add and edit operations.

**Step 1.** The user executes either:
- `add n/John Doe s/A0123456X e/john@u.nus.edu m/CS2103T c/22-10-2025 15:30`, or
- `edit 1 c/25-10-2025 14:00`  
  to add or update a studentâ€™s consultation record.

**Step 2.** The command is parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which identifies the command type (`add` or `edit`) and creates the respective command parser.

**Step 3.** The parser (`AddCommandParser` or `EditCommandParser`) processes the input:
- Extracts consultation values from each `c/` prefix
- Validates and parses them into `LocalDateTime` objects using multiple supported formats
- Creates a list of `Consultation` objects

**Step 4.** During command execution:
- The `AddCommand` constructs a new `Person` with the consultations included as part of their attributes
- The `EditCommand` retrieves the target `Person`, replaces their existing consultations with the new list, and updates the model
- Both commands call `Model#setPerson()` to commit the change

**Step 5.** The updated `Person` (with consultations) is persisted to storage and reflected in the UI.  
Consultation details can then be viewed through the `view` command, which displays all recorded consultations for that student in the result panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how consultations are processed as part of the add and edit workflows:

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Integration within `add` and `edit` commands vs standalone `consult` command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Integrate consultation handling within existing `add` and `edit` commands
    * Pros: Keeps the command set simple and intuitive â€” no need for an additional `consult` command. Ensures that all student-related data (attendance, consultations, grades) are managed consistently within a single workflow. Prevents duplicate logic for modifying the same `Person` object.
    * Cons: Less explicit â€” users cannot add a consultation directly without editing the student. Parsing logic for `add` and `edit` becomes more complex as new optional fields are introduced.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a dedicated `consult` command for adding consultations
    * Pros: Clear separation of concerns. Easier to track when consultations are added. Provides finer-grained control for managing consultation records.
    * Cons: Adds a new command and parser, increasing system complexity. Introduces overlapping functionality with `edit`. Users would need to remember and use multiple commands to update the same student record.

---

**Aspect: Consultation data structure**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store consultations as a list of `Consultation` objects within `Person`
    * Pros: Maintains a one-to-many relationship (one student â†’ many consultations). Easy to extend in the future (e.g., add notes or duration fields). Keeps related data encapsulated within the `Person` model.
    * Cons: Slightly larger memory footprint per student. Requires additional serialization logic for saving and loading lists of consultations.

* **Alternative 2:** Store consultations as a simple formatted `String` within `Person`
    * Pros: Simpler to implement and serialize. Minimal model changes required.
    * Cons: Harder to validate and manipulate programmatically. Loses type safety and flexibility for future enhancements.

---

**Aspect: Datetime input format**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accept multiple datetime formats for user flexibility
    * Pros: Improves user experience by accommodating a variety of date/time input styles. Reduces likelihood of input errors due to format mismatch.
    * Cons: Increases parser complexity â€” more code paths to validate and test. Slightly higher chance of ambiguity between formats.

* **Alternative 2:** Enforce a single strict datetime format (e.g., `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`)
    * Pros: Simpler parsing logic and clearer documentation. Ensures data consistency across all entries.
    * Cons: Less user-friendly; rejects valid but differently formatted datetimes. May frustrate users unfamiliar with the required format.

* needs to manage students across multiple modules
* responsible for tracking consultations and monitoring academic progress
* prefers quick keyboard-driven workflows during tutorials and consultations
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI-based desktop applications
* values efficiency and organization when handling large amounts of student data

**Value proposition**: manage student information and academic progress faster and more efficiently than a typical mouse/GUI-driven app.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should be intuitive enough for new TAs with basic command-line familiarity to perform core operations (add, view, list students) within 15 minutes of first use.
5. The system should not lose data during normal operations. All changes should be persisted to storage within 1 second of command execution.
6. Student IDs must remain unique across the system. The application should validate all NUS-specific formats (student IDs, module codes) to prevent invalid data entry.
7. All commands should execute and provide feedback within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
8. Should support TAs managing up to 10 different modules simultaneously without performance degradation.
9. Error messages should be clear, specific, and actionable, guiding users to correct their input without needing to reference documentation.
10. Code should follow standard software engineering practices to allow for incremental feature additions and modifications.
